# SpikesGame


My very first game created using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) Programming language.
It was created as a replica of the game [Don't Touch The Spikes](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
created by [Ketchapp](http://www.ketchappgames.com/) and was handed in as a final summative in my 
grade 10 programming course.

## Game Description

- **Game Type:** Arcade
- **Language:** Processing
- **Created For:** Desktop (any OS)

You (the ball) are bouncing back and forth between two walls. Spikes randomly appear on the
wall that you are headed towards and you must click the screen to cause the ball to bounce in 
such that you avoid these spikes. There are also a bunch of "easter eggs" and secret codes that
allow you to do some cool stuff and unlock some cool "skins". But you'll have to search for them 
yourself :D.

plug the board into a NeoPixel LED strip and read the code for the different functions.
